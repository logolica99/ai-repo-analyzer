## Installation

### From Source

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd github-repo-analyzer
pip install -e .
```

### Using pip

```bash
pip install github-repo-analyzer
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Basic analysis - user stories only
github-repo-analyzer analyze "owner/repo-name"

# Comprehensive analysis with architecture diagrams and API mapping
github-repo-analyzer analyze "owner/repo-name" --comprehensive

# Architecture-focused analysis (no user stories, just technical analysis)
github-repo-analyzer architecture "owner/repo-name"

# Analyze with custom output format
github-repo-analyzer analyze "owner/repo-name" --format json

# Analyze private repository (requires GitHub token)
github-repo-analyzer analyze "owner/repo-name" --token "your-github-token"
```

### Advanced Options

```bash
# Generate comprehensive analysis with specific focus
github-repo-analyzer analyze \
  "owner/repo-name" \
  --comprehensive \
  --focus "scalability" \
  --max-stories 8 \
  --output-file "comprehensive-analysis.md"

# Architecture analysis with focus on specific area

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Analysis

```bash
github-repo-analyzer analyze "facebook/react"
```

This will analyze the React repository and generate user stories focused on the core functionality.

### Example 2: Focused Analysis

```bash
github-repo-analyzer analyze \
  "microsoft/vscode" \
  --focus "developer-productivity" \
  --max-stories 8
```

This will analyze VS Code with a focus on developer productivity features.

### Example 3: Comprehensive Analysis

```bash
github-repo-analyzer analyze \
  "excalidraw/excalidraw" \
  --comprehensive \
  --format markdown \
  --output-file "excalidraw-full-analysis.md"
```

This generates a comprehensive analysis with system architecture diagrams, API mappings, and user stories.

### Example 4: Architecture-Only Analysis

```bash
github-repo-analyzer architecture \
  "facebook/react" \
  --focus "component-architecture"
```

This focuses purely on system architecture and technical analysis without user stories.

### Example 5: Test Enhanced Architecture Analysis

Test the comprehensive architecture analysis with Excalidraw:

```bash
github-repo-analyzer architecture \
  "excalidraw/excalidraw" \
  --output-file "excalidraw-comprehensive-architecture.md"
```

This will generate a comprehensive technical analysis including:
- **üèóÔ∏è System Architecture Diagrams**: Mermaid diagrams showing overall system, API flows, component relationships, and data flows
- **üåê API & Integration Analysis**: Detailed API endpoints, external services, authentication methods, and WebSocket events
- **üîß Technical Deep Dive**: Technology stack breakdown, build system details, performance optimizations, and security features

- Install Claude Code: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
- Ensure it's in your PATH

**"GitHub API rate limit exceeded"**
- Use a GitHub token for higher rate limits
- Wait for rate limit reset

**"Repository not found"**
- Check repository name format: "owner/repo-name"
- Ensure you have access to the repository
- Verify GitHub token permissions
