## üìã Technical Report

# Technical Architecture Report: Excalidraw

## Executive Summary

Excalidraw is a sophisticated open-source virtual whiteboard application built with a modern React and TypeScript stack. The application demonstrates excellent architectural decisions for real-time collaboration, offline-first functionality, and scalable drawing performance.

## System Architecture Overview

### Core Architecture Principles
- **Monorepo Structure**: Well-organized workspace with focused packages
- **Component-Based Design**: React components with clear separation of concerns  
- **State Management**: Jotai for atomic, reactive state management
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Socket.io with end-to-end encryption
- **Offline-First**: Local storage with cloud synchronization

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Canvas-Based Rendering**: HTML5 Canvas with RoughJS for hand-drawn aesthetics
2. **Package Architecture**: Modular packages (element, math, utils, common)
3. **Real-time Engine**: WebSocket-based collaboration with operational transform
4. **Data Persistence**: Multi-tier storage (LocalStorage, IndexedDB, Firebase)
5. **Security**: Client-side encryption for collaborative data

## Performance & Scalability

### Rendering Optimizations
- Multiple canvas layers for efficient rendering
- Virtualization for large drawings
- RAF-based throttled updates
- Memory management and element cleanup

### Collaboration Optimizations  
- Delta synchronization for bandwidth efficiency
- Conflict resolution with operational transform
- Efficient user presence tracking
- Throttled cursor and viewport updates

## Security Architecture

### Collaboration Security
- End-to-end encryption using client-side crypto
- Room-based access control
- Secure key generation and distribution
- No server-side access to decrypted content

### Data Protection
- Local-first data storage
- Encrypted payloads for all collaborative data
- Secure WebSocket connections (WSS)
- Input validation and sanitization

## Deployment & Infrastructure

### Frontend Deployment
- Vercel hosting for optimal performance
- CDN integration for global asset delivery
- Progressive Web App with offline capabilities
- Service Worker for background sync

### Backend Infrastructure
- Firebase Firestore for real-time data sync
- Firebase Storage for file management
- Firebase Authentication for user management
- Socket.io server for WebSocket communication

## Development Workflow

### Build System
- Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- TypeScript for type safety across the codebase
- Yarn workspaces for monorepo management
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality

### Testing Strategy
- Vitest for unit testing (60%+ coverage)
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Custom scenarios for collaboration testing
- Performance benchmarks for canvas operations

## Recommendations

### Strengths
- Excellent real-time collaboration architecture
- Strong security with E2E encryption
- Well-organized monorepo structure
- Comprehensive offline functionality
- High-performance canvas rendering

### Areas for Enhancement
- API documentation could be more comprehensive
- Testing coverage could be expanded to 80%+
- Performance monitoring and analytics
